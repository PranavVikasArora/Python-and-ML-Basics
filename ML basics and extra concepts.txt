Traditional programming -
inputs : data, program 
output : Output value

ML:
inputs: Data, outputs
output: Program

ML focuses on the developement of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

Installing packages : pip install package name

Note on Pie chart using matplotlib :
plt.pie[ads,labels = pielabels, colors = piecolors, explode(0,0.2,0,0,0)]
What is explode?
explode gives a gap between the pies in the pie chart, all categories will no have a gap(since wwe put 0) except for the one for which we put 0.2

Multi-index Matrix:
Suppose we have a data frame which looks like this :

         Res 1        Res 2
Slot1 1  some values
      2
      3 
Slot2 1
      2
      .
      .

it is called a multi indexed matrix

dataframe.loc['Slot1']
will give
         Res 1        Res 2
Slot1 1  some values
      2
      3 

To give name to an index :
dataframe.index.names['Slot','Var']

output:

                Res1        Res2
Slot  Var 
slot1 1
      2
      3
slot2 1 
      2
      3
