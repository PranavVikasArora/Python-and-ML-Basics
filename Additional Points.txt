The value_counts() function is used to get a Series containing counts of unique values.
Eg - Movies data set
Movie['Genre'].value_counts()
Output for this will be genre wise count 
Horror :35
Comedy : 40 and so on

The count() method returns the number of elements with the specified value.
Example :
Gives the total count of all the genres in the movie data set
Movie['Genre'].count()
Genre : 149 (total of all the genres) 



loc is label-based, which means that we have to specify the name of the rows and columns that we need to filter out.
On the other hand, iloc is integer index-based. So here, we have to specify rows and columns by their integer index.
